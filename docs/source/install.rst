Installation Guide
===================


The easiest way to install ``ffn`` is from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ffn/>`_
using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install ffn

Since ``ffn`` has many dependencies, we strongly recommend installing the `Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_. This distribution comes with many of the required packages pre-installed, including pip. Once Anaconda is installed, the above command should complete the installation.

``ffn`` is also available on `Conda Forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_, and installable via:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ conda install ffn --channel conda-forge


``ffn`` is compatible with Python >=3.7.
